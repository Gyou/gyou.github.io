Shuze Liu is an M.S. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Santa Clara
University. His research focuses on federated learning and
distributed systems, particularly on developing asynchronous federated learning
algorithms for non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. His goal is
to build scalable federated learning frameworks that can handle heterogeneous data
and device conditions, improving both training efficiency and model performance.
