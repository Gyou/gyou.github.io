I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at <a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/">Santa Clara University</a>. My research focuses on blockchain technology and its applications in distributed systems, e.g. Edge Computing, Internet of Things, Distributed Machine Learning. I'm also interested in applied data science for problem-solving with the application of machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement Learning.

**I am looking for multiple self-motivated PhD students who are interested in blockchain technology or edge computing and have necessary knowledge in machine learning or data science.** If you are interested in joining us, please send your resume to xli18@scu.edu. :grinning:
